        WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW

up until today, May 12th 2022, i didnt know:
`parseInt()` = The parseInt function converts its first argument to a string, parses that string, then returns an integer or NaN . If not NaN , the return value will be the integer that is the first argument taken as a number in the specified radix
`isNaN()` = Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether a value is the reserved value NaN (not a number).
